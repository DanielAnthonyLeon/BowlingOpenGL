I completed this assignment on computer gl07.

Compilation:
Navigate to the A5 folder. To run type './run.sh'.

Completion:
I wasn't able to get reflections. I added a sky map.

Manual:
Use the arrow keys to navigate the scene. Press the 'V' key to go to rotate view mode and use the mouse buttons to rotate the camera. Press the 'E' key to go back to play mode. In play mode press, move, and release the left mouse button to move the Earth bowling ball, and the right mouse button for the pink bowling ball.
